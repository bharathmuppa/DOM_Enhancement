     <li>The DOM represents a document as a tree. The tree is made up of parent-child relationships, a parent can have one or many children nodes..<pre>At the top level, there is an html node, with two children: head and body, among which only head has a child tag title.

HTML tags are element nodes in DOM tree, pieces of text become text nodes. Both of them are nodes, just the type is different.

â€¢The idea of DOM is that every node is an object. We can get a node and change its properties,.<pre></li>
